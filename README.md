### Tech Used:
 - React JS - Express J  - MongoDB - Node - Axios - CSS Bulma -Facebook Authentication 

## Description:

- Due to a small bug the Facebook authentication does work.. BUT only when the Heroku link is opened on INCOGNITO MODE on chrome. For the sake of funtionality please open through incognito. 

- Users are brought to the `Home` page where they can begin their search for any movie to store and look-up or watch later. The Movie info is then retrived from a Movie database API.

- When searching for a movie, users will see a list of relevant results. They can click `save` to save the book to the `Saved` page. The book is saved to the Mongo DB on the back end.
